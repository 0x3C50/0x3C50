# Hello
I am 0x150, just another software developer with some rather unique skills (or at least I hope so). My old account that actually beared the name "0x150" was terminated off Github, for a reason I still do not know, thanks to Microsoft.

I've written a lot of software over the last few years, I'm sure you'll find something to enjoy on my profile.
