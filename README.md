# Hello
I am 0x150, a (by definition) professional software engineer. My username is 0x3C50 because [my old one](https://github.com/0x150) was terminated without reason, and hasn't been reactivated since. Thanks Microsoft!

Anyways, I enjoy writing code, so I do just that. Feel free to look at my repositories or organisations, I'm sure you'll find something.
