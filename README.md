# Hello
I am 0x150, my username is 0x3C50 because [my old one](https://github.com/0x150) was terminated without reason, and hasn't been reactivated since. You wont be able to look at the link, because deactivated (or "flagged") accounts are not visible by other users. Welcome to the Microsoft experience!

Anyways, I enjoy writing code, so I do just that. Feel free to look at my repositories or organisations, I'm sure you'll find something.
